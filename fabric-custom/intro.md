## Validating the M/M/1 queue result
:::

::: {.cell .markdown}

In this experiment, you will explore the classic result regarding the queue length of the M/M/1 queue with a series of experiments on a testbed platform and with the ns2 simulator.

After completing this lab assignment, you should:

* Know how to run a basic queuing experiment on an experimental research testbed
* Be able to use `tc` to manipulate queues on Linux
* Be able to use the D-ITG traffic generator to generate traffic with specific properties on Linux
* Know how to run a basic queuing experiment in ns2
* Understand how to "sanity-check" an experiment to verify that it is a valid experiment
* Compare analytical, simulation, and testbed experiment results for the average length of the M/M/1 queue
